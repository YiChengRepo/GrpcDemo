# GrpcDemo
This is to demostrate 
1. ProtobufRepo is a separate repo
which can be build to via gradle proto plugin to genreate both client side and server side of code and being packaged into a JAR.
2. The generated Jar then can be used in GrpcClient 
3. The generated Jar then can be used in GrpcServer 

In the end GrpcClient can call GrpcServer easierly
